How to apply Coherence Annotations using Aspectj
================================================

cjansen18 [at] gmail.com

Here is a simple project that shows how to apply Coherence Portable Object Format (POF) annotations
using Aspectj aspects.  The approach may be used to apply Coherence POF annotations to an existing project containing a
large amount of existing classes.

The annotations are applied via the Maven build process using compile time weaving.

The aspects may be altered as needed to target specific packages/classes of interest.

See com.redsparksystems.pof.POFTest.testSerializationUsingAspects() for an example on how this is done.
